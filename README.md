- 👋 Hi, I’m @nickyg666 (Nick Gelinas)

- 👀 I’m interested in ... Linux in general - I don't care what spin flavor kernel bootloader architecture etc, LAMP stack/hosting services, system adminstration, Python and Bash, meeting people with similar interests — lots of stuff just ask or look around! 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... * python * * bash * systems/server administration (it never stops) * electrical engineering (electronics projects, SBCs, embedded stuff, AI-assisted reverse engineering etc) * * anything else I find that I'm curious about personally or professionally *

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... anything i'm useful for. anything at all really. I'm looking to meet more people that are into linux stuff, I only have 2 in my life right now and one is just an end user :/ I guess project maintainers should kind of count too? that's mostly strictly business though.
  
- 📫 How to reach me ... +1 (272) 446 0566 || nickgelinas@rocketmail.com || nickyg6667@gmail.com || find me in real life || indeed, facebook, linkedin, get in where you fit in!

- 💼 How to hire me ... Highest bidder wins! (I'm worth it - I'll show you!) Reach out above and I will link you my private repos as well. That goes for anybody; I don't care if it's about money or not.

- 🤝 How to make friends ... Just reach out, any way will do! I'm sure we can teach each other a lot of cool stuff!

- 🔒 Why do you have private repos?? ... If I exposed them publicly, they could cease to work for my purposes, or cause changes in how they work with the external hosts they do work with. The external hosts would be less than pleased with the methodologies used to access their resources. It is not done in an abusive fashion - but nonetheless violates the T&C of the sources they rely on. There may or may not be some public rated versions available already. Just ask about them!
